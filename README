fusefat-hdf

This is a FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
application to allow FAT filesystem images (including HDF hard disk images as
used by ZX Spectrum emulators such as Fuse and RealSpectrum) to be mounted and
accessed via native file commands.

Usage:

(for read-only access)
    fusefat -o rw+ [image-file] [mount-point]
(for read-write access - experimental)
    fusefat -o rw+ [image-file] [mount-point]

Limitations:
* Read/write support is experimental
* On partitioned devices, it will only mount the first primary FAT partition
  it finds
* Currently Linux-specific

Software released under GNU GPL license.

To generate the makefile use "./configure" 

At the moment the documentation is the code itself.

For the fuse module, try launch the executable and follow the help..
For the library, try look at the (messy) comments :)
